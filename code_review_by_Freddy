Amazed by the clean and clear file structure with files putting into folders where they belong to.

Also astonished by the complexity of your application.

Overall I love your application. The style, and the game logic.

Though I have some minor suggestions for your reference.

1. I think you can try different combination of the color in your landing page. 
I know you want to use red, black and white to make it in line with the style of poke ball. 
You can see the main is red and white whereas the red take much more space than white.
 
2. Maybe you can also try when a user logs out, he/she should exit the game. Now it keeps in it the next time he/she logs in.
   Until other user kills the game.
   

Now let's make it short and I am going to play it for a while. :)
